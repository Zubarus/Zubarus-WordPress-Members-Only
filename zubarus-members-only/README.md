# Zubarus - Members Only

The Zubarus - Members Only plugin for Wordpress allows you to restrict pages/posts to members that have verified their membership via the Zubarus API.

Guests that have not verified their membership will only see a placeholder text, which can be edited via the Wordpress dashboard.

**Important note**: Currently only the _content_ of the page is replaced with the placeholder text. The title of the page is untouched and will be displayed as normal to anyone.  
Restricted pages are also shown as norml to users that are logged into Wordpress normally and have the permissions to edit any posts or pages (editors, administrators etc.).

## Requirements

- A Wordpress site
- Zubarus API credentials

## Translations

Currently the plugin supports English and Norwegian (bokm√•l).  
Please note that the translations only affect the Wordpress dashboard / control panel and not the public-facing pages.  
For instance; The "Members Only" placeholder text is the same for all languages, so write somnething that covers the majority of your userbase.
